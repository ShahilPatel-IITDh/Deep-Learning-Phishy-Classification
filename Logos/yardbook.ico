  <h4>Content and Links of Third Party Websites</h4>
  
  <p>Yardbook, in its sole discretion, may provide links to other locations or websites on the Internet.   The content of such third party websites have not been reviewed by Yardbook and are maintained by third parties over which Yardbook has no control.  You acknowledge and agree that you use or follow these links entirely at your own risk. Yardbook is not responsible for the damage or loss suffered by you arising out of, or in connection with your access to or use of these third party websites, including, but not limited to, damage or loss to your computer system or loss of data arising from your use of documents or information found on these third party websites. Any links to such third-party websites are for your convenience and the inclusion of such links on our website does not imply any endorsement, guarantee, warranty or representation by Yardbook of the quality or accuracy of the content, information, products or services or other materials provided to you on those third party websites.</p>
  
  <h4>Taxes and Third-Party Fees</h4>
  
  <p>You are solely responsible for and must pay all applicable taxes, and any applicable third-party fee (such as telephone charges, mobile carrier fees, ISP charges, data plan charges, SMS and third-party payment processing fees) that may result from your use of our Services.</p>

  <h4>Consent to Send Text Messages</h4>


 <p> Prior to sending the first message, you must obtain agreement from the message recipient to communicate with them - this is referred to as "consent", you must make clear to the individual they are agreeing to receive messages of the type you're going to send. You need to keep a record of the consent, such as a copy of the document or form that the message recipient signed, or a timestamp of when the customer completed a sign-up flow. </p>

 <p> If an individual sends a message to you, you are free to respond in an exchange with that individual. For example, if an individual texts your phone number asking for your hours of operation, you can respond directly to that individual, relaying your open hours. In such a case, the individual’s inbound message to you constitutes both consent and proof of consent. Remember that the consent is limited only to that particular conversation. Unless you obtain additional consent, don't send messages that are outside that conversation. </p>

 <p> You may send a message to an individual where you have a prior relationship, provided that individual provided their phone number to you, and has taken some action to trigger the potential communication, and has not expressed a preference to not receive messages from you. Actions can include a button press, alert setup, appointments, or order placements. Examples of acceptable messages in these scenarios include appointment reminders, receipts, one-time passwords, order/shipping/reservation confirmations, drivers coordinating pick up locations with riders, and repair persons confirming service call times. In this case, the message can't attempt to promote a product, convince someone to buy something, or advocate for a social cause.</p>

  <h2>DMCA Policy</h2>

  <p>Yardbook is committed to protecting your privacy and providing you
 a safe online experience. This Privacy Statement applies to the 
Yardbook website, mobile application, and also governs its data 
collection and usage. By using the Yardbook website and/or mobile 
application, you consent to the data practices described herein.</p>
  
  <h4>DMCA Policy</h4>
  
  <p>Yardbook,  Inc. takes the intellectual property rights of others seriously and expects you to do the same on our Services.  We will respond to notices of copyright infringement that comply with the requirements of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("<b>DMCA</b>") (17 U.S.C. &sect; 512).  If you believe in good faith that User Content available through our Services infringes one or more of your copyrights, you may provide us written notice ("Take Down Notice") as described below.</p>

  <p><u>Take Down Notice</u>:</p>
  
  <p>Your Take Down Notice must include the following:</p>


  <ul>
  <li>A physical or electronic signature of the owner or a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
  <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (including a hyperlink to said work(s), if available), or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that website;</li>
  <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material (including a hyperlink to said work(s));</li>
  <li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email;</li>
  <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, his/her/its agent, or the law; and</li>
  <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><u>Steps to File a Take Down Notice</u>:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Verify that the webpage in question is hosted by Yardbook. We only host pages that have "yardbook.com" in their URL. Contact the listing party directly.</li>
  <li>Go to the listing post in question and send an email with your complaint to see if the matter can be resolved directly between you and the listing party.</li>
  <li>Send your Take Down Notice to our designated agent. If the issue cannot be resolved directly with the listing party, send your complaint to our designated agent at (we prefer email):<br /><br />
    <p>Mrs. Leaman<br />
    Email: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="aecac3cdcfeed7cfdccaccc1c1c580cdc1c3">[email&#160;protected]</a><br />
    Yardbook, Inc.<br />
    1900 S. Norfolk Street, Suite 350<br />
    San Mateo, CA 94403</p>
  </li>
  </ul>

  <p>For clarity, only DMCA notices or counter-notices should go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to Yardbook customer support by email at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7f0c0a0f0f100d0b3f061e0d1b1d101014511c1012">[email&#160;protected]</a>.  You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements as set forth herein, your DMCA notice may not be valid and may not be considered by Yardbook.</p>

  <h4>Your Take Down Notice may also be forwarded to the party that made the content available or to third parties such as ChillingEffects.org.</h4>
  
  <p><u>Counter-Notice To Restore Removed Content</u>:</p>
  
  <p>If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
  <li>Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
  <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content;</li>
  <li>Your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in the district where you live (if you reside in the U.S.), or your consent to the jurisdiction of a federal court in Pleasanton, California in Alameda County (if you reside outside the U.S.); and</li>
  <li>A statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Yardbook may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed User Content or cease disabling it in ten (10) business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the user content provider or user, the removed User Content may be replaced, or access to Yardbook's Services restored, at Yardbook's sole discretion.</p>

  <p><u>Repeat Infringer Policy</u>: Yardbook will terminate user accounts that have been subject to three (3) separate DMCA notices.  In the event a user's materials are removed based on a DMCA notice and then subsequently restored due to the filing of a DMCA counter-notification, the underlying DMCA notice will be deemed withdrawn for purposes of this policy.  We reserve the right to terminate user accounts subject to less than three (3) DMCA notices in appropriate circumstances (i.e. the user has a history of violating or willfully disregarding Yardbook's Terms of Service).</p>

  <p><u>Requests For Further Information</u>: To ensure a timely processing of your notice or counter-notice, please make sure you have complied with the steps set forth above.  If we request additional information required to make your DMCA notice or counter-notice complete, please provide that information promptly.  If you fail to comply with these requirements, we may not be able to process your notice or counter-notice.</p>

  <p><u>Bad Faith Conduct</u>: Please be advised that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that a product or activity infringes your copyright. If you are unsure whether User Content located on, or third-party content linked to our Services infringes your copyright, you should consult an attorney before submitting a Take Down Notice.</p>
