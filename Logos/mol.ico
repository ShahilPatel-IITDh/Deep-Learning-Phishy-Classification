        Just Stop Oil have interrupted a performance Les Miserables and shut down the show. Video shows the theatre crowd booing as eco-activists clambered onto the stage holding the group's orange banner at the Sondheim Theatre in Shaftesbury. Tickets for Les Mis - which is a musical about a failed rebellion against the French state - cost up to £200. The group said in a statement that four people were 'locked to the stage of the French-revolution-themed show'. It added: 'Valjean steals bread to feed a starving child. How long before we are all forced to steal? The fossil fuel show can't go on.' Just Stop Oil said two of the protesters were called Hanan - a 22-year-old student - and Noah, 18. In another video posted online eco-warrior Hanan said: 'I'm taking action with Just Stop Oil by disrupting a Les Mis performance tonight. 'Les Mis is about the June rebellion where ordinary people stood up, organised themselves against a government that consistently showed no interest in their wellbeing. 'The UK Government has approved hundreds of gas and oil licences knowing the full consequences this will have on our climate and our society.'

      Fox posed for the cameras outside Croydon's custody suite after he was released by officers. He was spotted scrunching a Tesco bag while also holding onto a copy of The Gulag Archipelago by Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Earlier today the 45-year-old political activist shared a video on X showing five police officers 'storming his home' as he was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to damage ULEZ cameras a day after he threatened to tear them down with an angle-grinder. Footage posted to social media showed the actor smoking a cigar in his living room as police officers appeared to search his home in south London before telling the camera: 'That, ladies and gentlemen, is the country that we live in'.

       Royal Artillery Gunner Jaysley-Louise Bek, 19, (right) died at Larkhill Camp in Wiltshire in December 2021 following an 'intense period' of 'unwelcome behaviour' from a superior, according to an armed forces inquiry report. The conduct of her immediate boss was 'almost certain' to be a 'causal factor' in her death, the report found. Her mother Leighan McCready (left) told the BBC: 'She was fed up with his behaviour, it started ruining a job she really enjoyed doing. She was always down. 'You think the easiest solution is to block him [on your phone], but you can't just block your boss.'

       Rishi Sunak made his pitch to voters to 'fix' Britain today as he dramatically cancelled the rest of HS2 to free up £36billion for 'hundreds' of better transport projects. The PM confirmed the HS2 move saying the scheme was the symbol of the 'old consensus' -  as he vowed to 'fundamentally change our country' and fix 'broken' politics like Margaret Thatcher did. In another bold step, Mr Sunak said he wants to introduce a rising age limit on buying cigarettes - so 14-year-olds now will never be able to purchase them legally. He insisted the policy - which will be put to a free vote in Parliament - would cut cancer deaths by a quarter and protect children. There will also be a crackdown on young people vaping. Meanwhile, A-Levels and T-Levels are being merged into a new broader Advanced British Standard, teachers of specialist subjects will be lured with £30,000 tax-free bonuses over the first five years, and there will be tougher sentences for the worst offenders. Summing up his policy blitz, Mr Sunak said: 'It's time for a change, and we are it.'

       QUENTIN LETTS: As Rishi Sunak approached the lectern he shot his wife Akshata the tiniest, loving little wink with his right eye. He a cool smoothie, Rishi. Mrs Sunak, with pop-eyed innocence, had just done a surprise turn as his warm-up artiste. Not that we needed warming up after Penny Mordaunt. Blimey, she was a pulsating combination of Boudicca, Henry V and Vyvyan from The Young Ones. 'Stand Up And Fight!' Ms Mordaunt kept bellowing. Michael Gove, blinking in the front row, looked as though he might spring a leak. HMS Mordaunt continued with her bombardment. Crush their walnuts! Kebab their kidneys! Something like that. My mother, watching from afar, said the BBC did not broadcast the Mordaunt speech. Too strong pre-watershed, perhaps. It was the conference equivalent to an All Black haka.

                Their famed Beckingham Palace reportedly had leopard print walls and mirrored ceilings - but the Beckhams' £12million Cotswold mansion is much more muted and sophisticated. Viewers got an glimpse into the Soho Farmhouse-inspired home as part of their new Netflix docuseries Beckham - where the couple showed off their very expensive taste and eye for classic designers, hardwood flooring and exposed brick walls. The couple, who share children Brooklyn, 24, Romeo, 21, Cruz, 18, and Harper, 12, snapped up their country retreat for a reported £6.15 million in December 2016. After the Beckhams' improvements, the property boasts a sauna, plunge pool, football pitch, gym, swimming pool and £50,000 safari tent in the grounds for entertaining. It is now thought to be worth about £12 million.'This is such a step away from any kind of footballer's home cliché, it's beautifully curated, smart and yet not flashy,' interiors expert Benji Lewis told MailOnline.

                This is believed to be the XL Bully (left) that mauled dog owner Ian Langley (right) to death while he was trying to protect his pup from the crazed animal which has allegedly attacked at least two dogs previously. The dog is said to have 'torn out the throat' of Mr Langley as he bent down to pick up his Patterdale terrier pup (inset). Mr Langley was left needing CPR for around 15 minutes as emergency services fought to staunch heavy bleeding from his wounds. The 54-year-old father tragically succumbed to his injuries. His dog survived. A 44-year-old man from the Maple Terrace area of Shiney Row, Sunderland, has been arrested on suspicion of murder.

       Freddie Flintoff described the last few months as the 'hardest of his life' while speaking publicly for the first time since his horrific Top Gear car crash which left him with face scars. The former England cricketer gave an emotional speech ahead of England's ODI clash with Ireland. He has been recovering from a high-speed crash while filming for Top Gear in December 2022, and has been spending time with the England white-ball side this summer.

       The officer shot Reed Wischhusen, 32, three times as he rushed towards him with the firearm held aloft. Police officers had gone to Wischhusen's dirty and smelly house that he shared with his father in Wick St Lawrence, north Somerset, in November last year following reports about him converting blank firearms. Four officers - two neighbour officers and two armed officers - carried out a brief examination of the semi-detached property, which was cluttered, dirty and smelled of urine, and found several weapons, as well as body armour and a deactivated hand grenade. The two firearms officers, known only as P3 and L4, decided a comprehensive search was needed and the Lidl warehouse worker would be arrested.

       Hospitality and real estate tycoon Vikas Oberoi, 54 (left), was allegedly driving a Lamborghini as part of an Italian supercar tour last week with his filmstar wife Gayatri Joshi (also left) sitting in the passenger seat. The pair were tucked up behind a large white motorhome on a single lane road as a red Ferrari approached at a high speed in an attempt to overtake both Oberoi and the RV in front. Shocking dash cam footage (right) showed how the Lamborghini suddenly darted out from behind the motorhome right into the path of the oncoming Ferrari, resulting in a huge crash that flipped the RV and sent the cars careening off the road. The red car, which also flipped upside down, immediately caught fire and whipped into a blazing inferno from which Swiss nationals Markus and Melissa Krautli (inset) were unable to escape. Oberoi and Joshi miraculously escaped without injury in the crash. But now, prosecutors in Cagliari have opened an investigation into 'double road homicide', meaning her husband could face up to seven years in jail.

       A pregnant bride (left) on her honeymoon was among those killed when a bus packed with tourists overturned (right) after plunging from an Italian bridge. Antonela Perkovic was among 21 people killed in the tragedy that also saw a newborn baby and two other children among the victims, with another 15 people injured. The tourist bus broke through a guardrail and   in Venice last night. Antonela's husband Marko Bakovic survived the crash which happened in the city of Mestre as the bus was taking day trippers back to a campsite from nearby Venice. The couple tied the knot in their home town of Split on the Croatian coast three weeks ago and were on an extended honeymoon.

                Phillip Schofield has been seen in public with his wife and daughter (left) for the first time since the affair scandal which ended his This Morning career. The 61-year-old enjoyed a rare outing with Stephanie Lowe and their daughter Molly in west London, despite previously confessing to his wife he had cheated on her with a younger male lover. The TV presenter was seen wearing a light blue jumper and carrying a dark blue jacket, and appeared deep in conversation with the pair as they walked down a residential street. And the former host of The British Soap Awards was seen in good spirits and cracking a smile as he walked into a London hotel with a mystery man yesterday (right).

       People can be seen clambering over the turnstiles at Chelmsford station and sprinting up the stairs to platform one as a train arrives. An onlooker can be heard wailing 'oh no' as others hold up their mobile phones to film the incident. A member of staff can be heard telling them as they rush away: 'The platform is full.' One person said there was confusion over whether commuters would be allowed to board an arriving train as it was already full. One man then jumped the barrier, they said which sparked others to follow. The eyewitness said the 'madness' unfolded as the 8.43am train to London Liverpool Street pulled in.

                A father from Luton, Bedfordshire, has been mocked online after putting a £750 price tag on his sofa - even though it is covered in his child's permanent marker drawings. The cream three-seater sofa, originally from DFS, is made of leather and two of the seats can recline. However, the couch has been scribbled all over with a black marker pen. Each cushion has different markings on it, including child drawings of cars. They appear on every part of the sofa, even the arms and front and the wall behind in seller Esfandiar Aria' living room. Despite the unsightly drawings, Mr Aria has listed the sofa for sale.

       Newcastle and PSG fans were seen clashing prior to their Champions League clash on Wednesday night. Eddie Howe's side will host the French champions for the second match of their European campaign this season, having been held to a 0-0 draw with AC Milan last time out. However, amongst the excitement tonight, there was some nasty scenes as supporters and fans clashed prior to kick-off at St James' Park.

       Elton, 76, has teamed up with Kate, 49, and a slew of other models in a new Charlotte Tilbury holiday beauty campaign that's set to shine a spotlight on those most affected by HIV. The brand revealed to DailyMail.com that the Rocket Man hitmaker, 76, has been snapped posing alongside a host of beautiful faces as they all showed off the makeup mogul's holiday edition items. To accompany the new lipstick shades, highlighting palettes, and more, Elton posed with Kate, 49, Charlotte, 50, and other models before he hit the piano and busted out a few holiday tunes while the beauties danced.

       David Beckham showed off his immaculately organised wardrobe as he spoke about his 'obsession' with keeping things in order.  The former footballer - who suffers with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) - gave fans a glimpse into his neat and tidy lifestyle as he  was filmed for his new Netflix docuseries BECKHAM.  The fourth and final episode opened with a throwback clip of David in his teenage years saying he always keeps his room clean, noting 'I hate an untidy room.'

In a sensational new Netflix documentary - released on the streaming giant today - the Beckhams have finally opened up about the scandal that almost broke their marriage almost 20 years ago. Victoria said the months afterwards were the 'hardest' of her life and that she no longer felt like the couple 'had each other' - while David admitted he still doesn't know how they got through the 2003 crisis, but he and his former Spice Girl wife knew they had to 'fight for their family'. The England star said they felt like they were 'drowning' as their high-profile marriage dominated headlines and Beckham told how he 'felt physically sick every day'. But this is a distant memory for Ms Loos, 45, who left the hustle and bustle of city life (left and right) after meeting her Norwegian doctor husband (inset) on the reality show 71 Degrees North. Inset, David Beckham chatting to Rebecca Loos in a trendy restaurant in Spain around the time of the alleged affair.

                This optical illusion can reveal whether you're someone who is very stubborn and achieves everything they put their mind to - or if you hate mind games and distance yourself from most people. The picture was shared this week by TikTok creator Mia Yilin, who boasts more than 450,000 followers on the video-sharing app. In the image, there is both a set of forks and a wine glass, and Mia revealed that the image you see first can offer a telling sign about your personality.

       EXCLUSIVE: Under-fire Premier League referee Darren England has been slammed for his astonishing blunder led to Liverpool being denied a legitimate goal - as he has been seen for the first time since his suspension over the error. England has been blasted for his 'critical concentration lapse' and prioritising 'efficiency over accuracy' for his performance during Saturday's match between Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool. In a hard-hitting report, referees' body the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) delivered a damning indictment of England's performance claiming that he rushed a routine situation and 'inexplicably' chalked off Luiz Diaz's disallowed goal. The report was sent to the Premier League but not disclosed to the public, with England bearing the brunt of the blame while his Video Assistant Referee (VAR) assistant Dan Cook was also criticised for their lack of basic communication. The referee's body said in its review seen by Mail Sport that the error came from 'a critical lapse in concentration and clear lack of focus… by an individual match official which saw him inexplicably 'check completing' an incorrect on-field decision.'

       Joking that the PM had no idea what she was intending to say, Mrs Murty said her husband of 14 years was her 'best friend' and he was summed up by the word 'aspiration'. She insisted it was the 'greatest honour' for him to be in charge of the country, and gave an impassioned endorsement of his character. 'He is fun, he is thoughtful, he is compassionate and he has an incredible zest for life,' she said. Following her on to the stage, a clearly touched Mr Sunak said: 'Thank you for always being there for me... Literally the best long-term decision for a brighter future I ever made.'

                Joy Millward (pictured right) is the wife of Robin Gunningham (left), 50, who has been named in a High Court lawsuit against 'The Artist known as Banksy' as the first defendant. Ms Millward is originally from the West Midlands and worked as a researcher for Labour MP Austin Mitchell. She is thought to have met Gunningham in around 2003. They wed in Las Vegas in 2006 but are understood to keep themselves to themselves, even amongst neighbours. One source said: 'Even those they occasionally speak to have no idea who they really are.'

                The Lionesses captain was named in the King's New Year's Honours list at the end of 2022 alongside her fellow teammates Lucy Bronze , Beth Mead , and Ellen White. England beat Germany 2-1 in the final at Wembley, with Chloe Kelly 's goal in extra-time giving the nation their first major honour since the men's side won the 1966 World Cup. Williamson, who has won six major trophies with Arsenal, was prevented from joining the Lionesses on their World Cup bid this summer after suffering a ruptured ACL in April. The Milton Keynes-born midfielder says she wants to be like a 'new signing' when she returns and is hoping for a January return to football.

       The Princess of Wales, 41, is visiting Vsi Razom Community Hub on its first anniversary after it was set up in October 2022 to help Ukrainian refugees in Bracknell who had been displaced by the war. The centre, which works with families and their children from Ukraine, supports them in integrating in the UK. As part of Kate's visit she is getting involved in helping pack support packages full of food and clothing which will be sent back to Ukraine. She is also meeting with a psychologist working with the hub, who provides mental health support to refugees.

       Alberto Rizzotto, 40, has been identified as the driver of the electric vehicle and was among those killed when it plunged 30 feet off a bridge and burst into flames on Tuesday evening. By Wednesday morning, 19 bodies had been pulled from the wreckage while a further two people died in hospital. Officials have said two children were killed and as many as 18 people were injured, five of whom are in a critical condition. Investigators are already pouring over footage from traffic cameras on the bridge which captured the crash unfold at around 7.45pm local time to determine the cause of what has been described by Venice's mayor as a 'huge tragedy'. One possible explanation being investigated is that the Rizzotto had a 'medical episode', officials said, with one noting that the road was 'straight and there were no bends' and that footage appeared to show the bus 'drifting' towards the guardrail.

       Gwyneth Paltrow has opened the doors to her own office. The 51-year-old Oscar-winning star showed of her GOOP think tank room on Instagram this week as she discussed what her likes are. The slender workout fanatic also shared what she eats for lunch (hint: it's far from a cheeseburger and fries), which was made by her 'GOOP kitchen.' 'Step into Gwyneth's office for the best book recs, chic wear-to-work inspo, and product sneak peeks,' the caption read. 'Tap to shop her look. And for more exclusive insights straight from Gwyneth (product launches included), sign up for our newsletter at the link in bio.' There were images of the striking blonde beauty everywhere - on her book and magazine covers - as she talked her love for her own clothing line, G Label. And there was also a rare photo of her mini-me teen daughter Apple Martin who is currently away at college.

       Britain's scruffiest house that desperate neighbour wanted squatters to take over as 'at least they'd look after it' has now been transformed into a plush £950-a-month rental property. In 2021 Peter Chidgey, then 69, said he had been trying to get the empty overgrown property at Anstey Crescent, Tiverton, Devon tidied up for years. He had lived there for 34 years and said problems with the neighbouring, privately owned home began around ten years prior.

       PJ Challenger (pictured right) was riding his motorbike in Wetton, Staffordshire, on Sunday when he spotted the woman leading her horse in the distance as he entered the tunnel. The 36-year-old applied the brakes and coasted through the tunnel in an effort to avoid startling the horse, but his thoughtful actions won him no favours with the rider. Instead, the woman bizarrely began to shout and branded him a 'f***ing idiot'. Mr Challenger shared the clip to social media yesterday with the caption: 'You know I love horses, but this person...not so much.'

       MailOnline Travel Editor Ted Thornhill (inset) filmed his cycling commute to and from the Mail Kensington HQ to 'show you the reality that we cyclists face every day... from the good to the bad to the ugly'. He adds: 'The journey, along parts of the 340km- (211-mile) long cycling network in London, takes me past some of Britain's most famous landmarks, through one of its priciest postcodes, past one of its swankiest hotels and I take in one of its most renowned concert halls.'

       After watching biscuit week on the Great British Bake Off, which aired on Channel 4 last night, viewers took to Twitter to express their love for the amateur baker, from Herefordshire. The second episode of the series saw the 50-year-old baker produce a batch of pistachio, raspberry and marshmallow biscuits for the judges, and at the beginning of the episode she told host Alison Hammond (left) that she doesn't bake biscuits very often - only 'once a week'. Alison looked stunned and suggested baking biscuits once a week is actually very frequent, but Saku wasn't quite sure. Viewers were quick to praise Saku's 'adorable' nature and expressed their desire for her to win the entire series.

                Speaking to the BBC Harry Maddox, from Cornwall detailed how he built the intricate rock sculpture in under an hour on Porthpean beach in Cornwall, while his wife did the supermarket. The artist named the Moongate structure after his niece, Leanne. He has created these structures up and down the country in places such as Anglesey and Dorset.

       MailOnline Travel's Ted Thornhill checked in to Titanic Hotel Liverpool, which won the Large Hotel of the Year gong at this year's VisitEngland Awards for Excellence. The hotel is located on a site used as a filming location for Captain America: The First Avenger, 2009's Sherlock Holmes and a gritty scene in Peaky Blinders. Ted writes: 'These days the Victorian North Warehouse looks almost unrecognisable from its screen appearances thanks to a £36million regeneration project that has put Titanic Hotel Liverpool centre stage on the site since it opened in 2014.'

                A former hairdresser transitioned to be female at 69 years old after years of pretending to be hyper-masculine. Phillis Price, 70, who worked as a successful hairdresser for 45 years and now lives in Washington, calls the time before her transition 'the dark years'. She lived in 'despair' for more than 60 years, felt hollow inside, 'spent her alone time crying', and isolated herself from relationships.
