# Hello. My name is Chris, and I am an ethical computer security researcher.
# 
# If you are reading this, your computer has attempted to connect to
# Command-and-Control (C&C) infrastructure, and is very likely infected with
# ViperSoftX malware. You need to disinfect your computer immediately.
# 
# You can read more about ViperSoftX malware here:
# https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-chrome-extension-used-to-steal-cryptocurrency-passwords/
# 
# Frequently Asked Questions:
# 
# * Question: What's happening?
#   Answer: I have purchased some domains used by ViperSoftX and made them return
#     this harmless response. This may help mitigate the malware's effect briefly.
#
# * Question: Did you write ViperSoftX?
#   Answer: No.
# 
# * Question: Can you help me get rid of ViperSoftX?
#   Answer: No, I'm sorry. Please use your normal antivirus provider.
#     I am working to bring attention to this particular strain of ViperSoftX
#     so that more antivirus companies detect it and remove it from your system
#     automatically. I wrote about that here (warning, it's a technical read):

#
# * Question: So what do I do now?
#   Answer: Disinfect your computer with your current antivirus provider.
#     If you're concerned that your antivirus isn't deleting ViperSoftX, please
#     reach out to your antivirus provider's support team.
# 
# Again, please disinfect your computer immediately, and stay safe.
