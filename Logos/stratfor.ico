The number of illegal border crossings from Mexico to the United States has surged in recent weeks, growing from 144,570 crossings in June to 232,972 in August, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data. While data is not yet available for the full month of September, reports indicate that the month is on track to surpass the record 252,000 border crossings recorded in December 2022. The influx of migrants reaching the southern U.S. border has strained CBP resources, leading to the closure of some official crossings to divert personnel to support migrant processing efforts. Closures and increased inspections have led to massive delays for cargo vehicles waiting to cross into the United States, with thousands of trucks stranded due to wait times lasting multiple days in some areas. Migrants are continuing to arrive en masse at the border, with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador saying on Oct. 2 that 10,000 migrants are reaching the border each day.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696540767","created_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 21:19 GMT","changed":"1696540767","changed_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 21:19 GMT","path_alias":"article/political-and-economic-implications-us-mexico-border-crisis","article_type":{"tid":"502","vid":"30","name":"Assessments"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"49","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Mexico","code":"MX","path_alias":"/region/americas/mexico"},{"tid":"59","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"United States","code":"US","path_alias":"/region/americas/united-states"},{"tid":"528","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Economics","path_alias":"/topic/economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"49","vid":"5","name":"Mexico"},{"tid":"59","vid":"5","name":"United States"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"528","vid":"33","name":"Economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342789","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"Syria's Economic Woes Create New Fractures and Power Struggles","promo_image":{"uri":"public://GettyImages-1637446734.jpg","alt":"People protest in the southern Syrian city of Sweida on Sept. 1, 2023, after the government of President Bashar al Assad ended fuel subsidies.","title":"People protest in the southern Syrian city of Sweida on Sept. 1, 2023, after the government of President Bashar al Assad ended fuel subsidies.","caption":"People protest in the southern Syrian city of Sweida on Sept. 1, 2023, after the government of President Bashar al Assad ended fuel subsidies.\r\n","credit":"(SAM HARIRI/AFP via Getty Images)","sizes":{"16x9":{"tiny":"16x9_tiny/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=rm0x0sX9","small":"16x9_small/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=G6LsDa28","medium":"16x9_medium/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=ISH9Mgy4","large":"16x9_large/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=iDChwvZd","full":"16x9_full/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=rH9r2Awx"},"square":{"tiny":"square_tiny/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=d2dfNMtQ","small":"square_small/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=JQBAcCis","medium":"square_medium/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=iep6L09S","large":"square_large/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=9lICAEN6","full":"square_full/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=IkqOIqHW"},"article":{"tiny":"article_tiny/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=eCHCdqTQ","small":"article_small/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=4O1EmNDT","medium":"article_medium/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=IFxhJqnv","large":"article_large/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=adnoeueA","full":"article_full/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=_1Yyuyum"},"2x1":{"tiny":"2x1_tiny/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=sfVu7QgR","small":"2x1_small/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=NkWNaXPg","medium":"2x1_medium/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=V5FYCDPK","large":"2x1_large/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=cMJS-aHH","full":"2x1_full/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=sIBZXPGy"}}},"teaser_body":"Growing economic distress and frozen reconstruction efforts are threatening the legitimacy of established actors, providing space for extremists to exploit.","pov":"","mailout":"In Syria, growing economic distress and frozen reconstruction efforts are threatening the legitimacy of established actors, in turn providing space for extremists to exploit. Fighting in Syria has dramatically declined as the frontlines of the civil war have largely been frozen since 2020. But new fractures have recently begun to emerge behind those established frontlines. Since August, a series of protests and skirmishes have broken out in territory nominally controlled by one of Syria's major factions. In the government-controlled southern city of Swedia, Druze demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest against President Bashar al Assad's economic policies, resulting in violence between protesters and government forces. Meanwhile, in the northwest, a dispute over sharing oil revenues triggered bloody clashes last month between ostensibly allied Arab tribes and the U.S.-aligned Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), leading to the deaths of dozens of fighters. The unrest took place against the backdrop of President Assad's first state visit to China since 2004, where he attempted to win Chinese aid to help foot his war-torn country's U.N.-estimated $500 billion reconstruction bill. But he left the visit without any concrete funding pledges, with China only promising to continue supporting Syria, which is a member of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) member. ","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696532034","created_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 18:53 GMT","changed":"1696532034","changed_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 18:53 GMT","path_alias":"article/syrias-economic-woes-create-new-fractures-and-power-struggles","article_type":{"tid":"502","vid":"30","name":"Assessments"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"136","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Syria","code":"SY","path_alias":"/region/middle-east-and-north-africa/syria"},{"tid":"528","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Economics","path_alias":"/topic/economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"136","vid":"5","name":"Syria"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"528","vid":"33","name":"Economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342775","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"Are Serbia and Kosovo Headed for Another War?","promo_image":{"uri":"public://serbia-kosovo-1242242750.jpg","alt":"NATO soldiers serving in Kosovo patrol next to a road barricade set up by ethnic Serbs near the town of Zubin Potok on Aug. 1, 2022.

The statement comes after Kirby on Sept. 29 revealed an ''unprecedented'' deployment of Serbian troops along the border and announced that NATO would be deploying more peacekeepers in northern Kosovo to deter a possible invasion. In the intervening days, following U.S. and EU pressure, Serbian officials stated that they had withdrawn some of the troops their country had stationed near the border, taking the overall number from 8,350 down to 4,500 forces.

Numerous news outlets have further highlighted that Schumer and Crapo plan to specifically discuss Beijing's treatment of U.S. memory chipmaker Micron, on which China placed purchasing restrictions in May in what appeared to be retaliation for U.S. export restrictions on semiconductor technology to China. After visiting China, the same group of U.S. senators will then travel to South Korea and Japan, other key players in global chip markets.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696364727","created_formatted":"Oct 3, 2023 | 20:25 GMT","changed":"1696364727","changed_formatted":"Oct 3, 2023 | 20:25 GMT","path_alias":"article/setting-expectations-first-us-congressional-visit-china-years","article_type":{"tid":"505","vid":"30","name":"Snapshots"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"59","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"United States","code":"US","path_alias":"/region/americas/united-states"},{"tid":"195","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"China","code":"CN","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/china"},{"tid":"524","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Environment, Science \u0026 Technology","path_alias":"/topic/environment-science-technology"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"59","vid":"5","name":"United States"},{"tid":"195","vid":"5","name":"China"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"524","vid":"33","name":"Environment, Science \u0026 Technology"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"},{"tid":"1661","vid":"33","name":"U.S.-China Relations"}],"is_bookmarked":0}],"topics_and_themes":[{"tid":"528","vid":"33","term_name":"Economics","vocabulary_machine_name":"wv_topics","path_alias":"/topic/economics"},{"tid":"540","vid":"33","term_name":"Cyber","vocabulary_machine_name":"wv_topics","path_alias":"/topic/cyber-0"},{"tid":"526","vid":"33","term_name":"Energy","vocabulary_machine_name":"wv_topics","path_alias":"/topic/energy"},{"tid":"1840","vid":"33","term_name":"Russia-Ukraine Conflict","vocabulary_machine_name":"wv_topics","path_alias":"/topic/russia-ukraine-conflict"},{"tid":"524","vid":"33","term_name":"Environment, Science \u0026 Technology","vocabulary_machine_name":"wv_topics","path_alias":"/topic/environment-science-technology"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","term_name":"Politics","vocabulary_machine_name":"wv_topics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"content_blocks":[{"title":"Latest","template_id":"template26","limit":"12","type":"","subqueue_id":"","exclude_global_perspectives":0,"exclude_snapshots":0,"exclude_interactives":0,"exclude_columns":0,"exclude_media":0,"nodes":[{"nid":"342793","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"RANE Insights: The Future of Cyber Insurance","promo_image":{"uri":"public://RANE Insight_1_34.png","alt":"RANE Insights thumbnail","title":"","caption":"","credit":"(RANE)","sizes":{"16x9":{"tiny":"16x9_tiny/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=XwLxeDPI","small":"16x9_small/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=2k_pIUbp","medium":"16x9_medium/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=Q4ljMMVl","large":"16x9_large/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=5_rFUOp5","full":"16x9_full/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=-4FayXuy"},"square":{"tiny":"square_tiny/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=IEItDXX5","small":"square_small/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=CCyKCYjV","medium":"square_medium/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=WxV-FEHy","large":"square_large/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=bYPm96WO","full":"square_full/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=mLtrouMv"},"article":{"tiny":"article_tiny/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=hIwBE3zH","small":"article_small/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=cxU6rALz","medium":"article_medium/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=byossFnu","large":"article_large/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=hNUN4Elp","full":"article_full/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=dvO2R9AA"},"2x1":{"tiny":"2x1_tiny/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=AanNq8_O","small":"2x1_small/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=R5PC__nu","medium":"2x1_medium/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=9snk89UO","large":"2x1_large/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=49pyQb3C","full":"2x1_full/public/RANE%20Insight_1_34.png?itok=-xo1pEd-"}}},"teaser_body":"Will there be opportunities for companies to hedge against cyber risks?

Since taking office in 2018, President Solih has strengthened the Maldives' historically close ties with India, and has pledged to maintain his pro-India approach if elected for another term. Muizzu, by contrast, has positioned himself as the pro-China candidate and has promised to scale back India's deep-rooted influence in the country while bolstering the Maldives' ties with Beijing. ","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696018079","created_formatted":"Sep 29, 2023 | 20:07 GMT","changed":"1696018079","changed_formatted":"Sep 29, 2023 | 20:07 GMT","path_alias":"article/election-runoff-could-alter-maldives-balance-between-china-and-india","article_type":{"tid":"505","vid":"30","name":"Snapshots"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"195","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"China","code":"CN","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/china"},{"tid":"119","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Maldives","code":"MV","path_alias":"/region/south-asia/maldives"},{"tid":"118","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"India","code":"IN","path_alias":"/region/south-asia/india"},{"tid":"528","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Economics","path_alias":"/topic/economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"195","vid":"5","name":"China"},{"tid":"119","vid":"5","name":"Maldives"},{"tid":"118","vid":"5","name":"India"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"528","vid":"33","name":"Economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"290404","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"Geopolitical Calendar","promo_image":{"uri":"public://geo-cal-2021.jpg","alt":"","title":"","caption":"","credit":"","sizes":{"16x9":{"tiny":"16x9_tiny/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=cYGEhc_W","small":"16x9_small/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=AVxoAV52","medium":"16x9_medium/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=9nhFETCL","large":"16x9_large/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=NbPCWoQu","full":"16x9_full/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=KBqddKMq"},"square":{"tiny":"square_tiny/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=khRV1v6P","small":"square_small/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=iRva8w-5","medium":"square_medium/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=03iwNNsb","large":"square_large/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=5MS1UHvC","full":"square_full/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=PWILQ26u"},"article":{"tiny":"article_tiny/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=5MG8ChnA","small":"article_small/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=6DZHtAvr","medium":"article_medium/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=_jfvzWMe","large":"article_large/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=VWel-8fP","full":"article_full/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=oR-sUCG_"},"2x1":{"tiny":"2x1_tiny/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=0zA3LSYx","small":"2x1_small/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=JumOsf60","medium":"2x1_medium/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=2fOZ3Yn0","large":"2x1_large/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=iIcX9S3K","full":"2x1_full/public/geo-cal-2021.jpg?itok=eI4HwmhE"}}},"teaser_body":"Stay informed about the significant meetings and events RANE analysts are tracking.","pov":"","mailout":"Stay informed about the significant meetings and events RANE analysts are tracking.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696015389","created_formatted":"Sep 29, 2023 | 19:23 GMT","changed":"1696015389","changed_formatted":"Sep 29, 2023 | 19:23 GMT","path_alias":"article/geopolitical-calendar","article_type":{"tid":"502","vid":"30","name":"Assessments"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342722","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"Strategic Goals and Political Hurdles in the U.S. Play Tug-of-War Over the Pacific Islands","promo_image":{"uri":"public://Pacific Island Forum GettyImages-1700706570.jpg","alt":"Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marapeand, the Cook Islands' Prime Minister Mark Brown, U.S. President Joe Biden and Kiribati's President Taneti Maamau at the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) as part of the U.S.-PIF summit at the White House on Sept. 25, 2023, in Washington, D.C.","title":"Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marapeand, the Cook Islands' Prime Minister Mark Brown, U.S. President Joe Biden and Kiribati's President Taneti Maamau at the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) as part of the U.S.-PIF summit at the White House on Sept. 25, 2023, in Washington, D.C.","caption":"\u003cp\u003ePapua New Guinea\u0026#39;s Prime Minister James Marapeand, the Cook Islands\u0026#39;

The United States and the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) concluded their second annual summit in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 25. At the summit, the U.S. government promised development and infrastructure aid packages totaling $200 million in new funds, a relatively large sum even when spread across 18 countries given these states' small economies. Most notably, the package includes $64 million in development aid and $40 million in infrastructure aid. The United States also announced its formal recognition of the Cook Islands and Niue, two small island countries that outsource their defense to New Zealand, as independent nations. According to Washington, its cooperation with countries and territories in Oceania is aimed at addressing climate change, protecting maritime boundaries and marine resources (a reference to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, specifically by China), and promoting \"a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\" During the Sept. 25 summit, the countries also reaffirmed the 2022 U.S.-Pacific Partner Strategy, the flagship document that codified the U.S.-PIF partnership and the key deliverable of last year's inaugural U.S.-PIF summit. Moreover, on Sept. 28, media reports revealed that the United States is backing the construction of the Central Pacific Cable, an undersea internet cable covering thousands of miles that will link U.S. territories American Samoa and Guam before extending to 10 Pacific island countries and territories.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696002806","created_formatted":"Sep 29, 2023

On Sept. 27, the Burkinabe junta issued a statement claiming it had successfully thwarted a coup launched by other members of the military the day before. According to an official statement, the perpetrators of the attempted coup are now in custody, while efforts are underway to apprehend others involved. The announcement comes days after rumors surfaced on social media that several members of the military tried to overthrow Burkina Faso's interim president Ibrahim Traore. It's unclear whether the junta's claims are legitimate, as Traore's military government could be using an attempted coup as an excuse to further consolidate its political power by arresting would-be dissenters. Earlier in September, a separate group of military officers were detained due to suspicions of involvement in another coup attempt.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1695936766","created_formatted":"Sep 28, 2023 | 21:32 GMT","changed":"1695936766","changed_formatted":"Sep 28, 2023 | 21:32 GMT","path_alias":"article/what-alleged-coup-attempt-means-burkina-fasos-stability","article_type":{"tid":"505","vid":"30","name":"Snapshots"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"144","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Burkina Faso","code":"BF","path_alias":"/region/sub-saharan-africa/burkina-faso"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"144","vid":"5","name":"Burkina Faso"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342716","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"Would Israeli-Saudi Normalization Bring the Regional Order the U.S. Wants?","promo_image":{"uri":"public://GettyImages-1241914104 (1).jpg","alt":"U.S. President Joe Biden makes his way to board Air Force One at Israel's Ben Gurion Airport on July 15, 2022, as he departs for Saudi Arabia after a two-day visit to Israel.

The influx of migrants reaching the southern U.S. border has strained CBP resources, leading to the closure of some official crossings to divert personnel to support migrant processing efforts. Closures and increased inspections have led to massive delays for cargo vehicles waiting to cross into the United States, with thousands of trucks stranded due to wait times lasting multiple days in some areas.

Fighting in Syria has dramatically declined as the frontlines of the civil war have largely been frozen since 2020. But new fractures have recently begun to emerge behind those established frontlines. Since August, a series of protests and skirmishes have broken out in territory nominally controlled by one of Syria's major factions. In the government-controlled southern city of Swedia, Druze demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest against President Bashar al Assad's economic policies, resulting in violence between protesters and government forces. Meanwhile, in the northwest, a dispute over sharing oil revenues triggered bloody clashes last month between ostensibly allied Arab tribes and the U.S.-aligned Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), leading to the deaths of dozens of fighters. The unrest took place against the backdrop of President Assad's first state visit to China since 2004, where he attempted to win Chinese aid to help foot his war-torn country's U.N.-estimated $500 billion reconstruction bill. But he left the visit without any concrete funding pledges, with China only promising to continue supporting Syria, which is a member of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) member. ","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696532034","created_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 18:53 GMT","changed":"1696532034","changed_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 18:53 GMT","path_alias":"article/syrias-economic-woes-create-new-fractures-and-power-struggles","article_type":{"tid":"502","vid":"30","name":"Assessments"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"136","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Syria","code":"SY","path_alias":"/region/middle-east-and-north-africa/syria"},{"tid":"528","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Economics","path_alias":"/topic/economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"136","vid":"5","name":"Syria"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"528","vid":"33","name":"Economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342771","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"U.S. Naval Update Map: Oct. 5, 2023","promo_image":{"uri":"public://naval-update-map-20231004-display.png","alt":"Naval Update Map display","title":"","caption":"","credit":"(RANE)","sizes":{"16x9":{"tiny":"16x9_tiny/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=o2H12g68","small":"16x9_small/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=_tkyAEfD","medium":"16x9_medium/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=x1RY9mfQ","large":"16x9_large/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=nNGtzF4p","full":"16x9_full/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=ABOGstRn"},"square":{"tiny":"square_tiny/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=_4QlgWUn","small":"square_small/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=HEFvswlG","medium":"square_medium/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=u0Abykda","large":"square_large/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=PTP5BJgQ","full":"square_full/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=QUQFjkEL"},"article":{"tiny":"article_tiny/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=m7uaTudq","small":"article_small/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=dJwQEfjS","medium":"article_medium/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=ZwrJjeus","large":"article_large/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=qAbjK3XG","full":"article_full/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=96Q4Ovse"},"2x1":{"tiny":"2x1_tiny/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=b8RYIavH","small":"2x1_small/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=MOAxNxyo","medium":"2x1_medium/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=lv7I0YvF","large":"2x1_large/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=6LbE8Tqo","full":"2x1_full/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=IS6n_p5G"}}},"teaser_body":"This map shows the approximate locations of U.S. Carrier Strike Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups.","pov":"","mailout":"The Naval Update Map shows the approximate current locations of U.S. Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) and Amphibious Ready Groups (ARGs), based on available open-source information.

The statement comes after Kirby on Sept. 29 revealed an ''unprecedented'' deployment of Serbian troops along the border and announced that NATO would be deploying more peacekeepers in northern Kosovo to deter a possible invasion. In the intervening days, following U.S. and EU pressure, Serbian officials stated that they had withdrawn some of the troops their country had stationed near the border, taking the overall number from 8,350 down to 4,500 forces. In an Oct. 2 interview with the Financial Times, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said that Belgrade does not seek a war with Kosovo, and his army chief General Milan Mojsilovic confirmed the country had not ''raised the level of readiness.''","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696446687","created_formatted":"Oct 4, 2023 | 19:11

The United States and the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) concluded their second annual summit in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 25. At the summit, the U.S. government promised development and infrastructure aid packages totaling $200 million in new funds, a relatively large sum even when spread across 18 countries given these states' small economies. Most notably, the package includes $64 million in development aid and $40 million in infrastructure aid. The United States also announced its formal recognition of the Cook Islands and Niue, two small island countries that outsource their defense to New Zealand, as independent nations. According to Washington, its cooperation with countries and territories in Oceania is aimed at addressing climate change, protecting maritime boundaries and marine resources (a reference to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, specifically by China), and promoting \"a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\" During the Sept. 25 summit, the countries also reaffirmed the 2022 U.S.-Pacific Partner Strategy, the flagship document that codified the U.S.-PIF partnership and the key deliverable of last year's inaugural U.S.-PIF summit. Moreover, on Sept. 28, media reports revealed that the United States is backing the construction of the Central Pacific Cable, an undersea internet cable covering thousands of miles that will link U.S. territories American Samoa and Guam before extending to 10 Pacific island countries and territories.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696002806","created_formatted":"Sep 29, 2023 | 15:53 GMT","changed":"1696002806","changed_formatted":"Sep 29, 2023 | 15:53 GMT","path_alias":"article/strategic-goals-and-political-hurdles-us-play-tug-war-over-pacific-islands","article_type":{"tid":"502","vid":"30","name":"Assessments"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"59","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"United States","code":"US","path_alias":"/region/americas/united-states"},{"tid":"192","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Australia","code":"AU","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/australia"},{"tid":"747","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Samoa","code":"WS","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/samoa"},{"tid":"195","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"China","code":"CN","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/china"},{"tid":"197","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Federated States of Micronesia","code":"FM","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/federated-states-micronesia"},{"tid":"198","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Fiji","code":"FJ","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/fiji"},{"tid":"201","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Kiribati","code":"KI","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/kiribati"},{"tid":"204","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Marshall Islands","code":"MH","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/marshall-islands"},{"tid":"207","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Nauru","code":"NR","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/nauru"},{"tid":"208","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/new-zealand"},{"tid":"210","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Palau","code":"PW","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/palau"},{"tid":"211","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Papua New Guinea","code":"PG","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/papua-new-guinea"},{"tid":"214","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Solomon Islands","code":"SB","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/solomon-islands"},{"tid":"218","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Tonga","code":"TO","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/tonga"},{"tid":"219","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Tuvalu","code":"TV","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/tuvalu"},{"tid":"220","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Vanuatu","code":"VU","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/vanuatu"},{"tid":"528","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Economics","path_alias":"/topic/economics"},{"tid":"524","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Environment, Science \u0026 Technology","path_alias":"/topic/environment-science-technology"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"59","vid":"5","name":"United States"},{"tid":"192","vid":"5","name":"Australia"},{"tid":"747","vid":"5","name":"Samoa"},{"tid":"195","vid":"5","name":"China"},{"tid":"197","vid":"5","name":"Federated States of Micronesia"},{"tid":"198","vid":"5","name":"Fiji"},{"tid":"201","vid":"5","name":"Kiribati"},{"tid":"204","vid":"5","name":"Marshall Islands"},{"tid":"207","vid":"5","name":"Nauru"},{"tid":"208","vid":"5","name":"New Zealand"},{"tid":"210","vid":"5","name":"Palau"},{"tid":"211","vid":"5","name":"Papua New Guinea"},{"tid":"214","vid":"5","name":"Solomon Islands"},{"tid":"218","vid":"5","name":"Tonga"},{"tid":"219","vid":"5","name":"Tuvalu"},{"tid":"220","vid":"5","name":"Vanuatu"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"528","vid":"33","name":"Economics"},{"tid":"524","vid":"33","name":"Environment, Science \u0026 Technology"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"},{"tid":"1661","vid":"33","name":"U.S.-China Relations"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342698","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"The Appeal (and Perils) of Crime Crackdowns in Latin America, Part 2","promo_image":{"uri":"public://el-salvador-1473759584.jpg","alt":"Salvadoran security forces move a second group of 2,000 detainees overnight to the mega-prison Terrorist Confinement Center on March 15, 2023, in Tecoluca, El Salvador.

Since taking office in 2018, President Solih has strengthened the Maldives' historically close ties with India, and has pledged to maintain his pro-India approach if elected for another term. Muizzu, by contrast, has positioned himself as the pro-China candidate and has promised to scale back India's deep-rooted influence in the country while bolstering the Maldives' ties with Beijing. ","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696018079","created_formatted":"Sep 29, 2023 | 20:07 GMT","changed":"1696018079","changed_formatted":"Sep 29, 2023 | 20:07 GMT","path_alias":"article/election-runoff-could-alter-maldives-balance-between-china-and-india","article_type":{"tid":"505","vid":"30","name":"Snapshots"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"195","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"China","code":"CN","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/china"},{"tid":"119","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Maldives","code":"MV","path_alias":"/region/south-asia/maldives"},{"tid":"118","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"India","code":"IN","path_alias":"/region/south-asia/india"},{"tid":"528","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Economics","path_alias":"/topic/economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"195","vid":"5","name":"China"},{"tid":"119","vid":"5","name":"Maldives"},{"tid":"118","vid":"5","name":"India"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"528","vid":"33","name":"Economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342718","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"What an Alleged Coup Attempt Means for Burkina Faso's Stability","promo_image":{"uri":"public://GettyImages-1243993988.jpg","alt":"Ibrahim Traore, Burkina Faso's interim president, attends a ceremony in Ouagadougou on Oct. 15, 2022.","title":"Ibrahim Traore, Burkina Faso's interim president, attends a ceremony in Ouagadougou on Oct. 15, 2022.","caption":"Ibrahim Traore, Burkina Faso's interim president, attends a ceremony in Ouagadougou on Oct. 15, 2022.","credit":"(OLYMPIA DE MAISMONT/AFP via Getty Images)","sizes":{"16x9":{"tiny":"16x9_tiny/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=18T69Qi8","small":"16x9_small/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=sSYFAKIJ","medium":"16x9_medium/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=jXDkJ_Lu","large":"16x9_large/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=aXxELolN","full":"16x9_full/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=H5qq8HHy"},"square":{"tiny":"square_tiny/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=oR_2uW65","small":"square_small/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=G7h8hViv","medium":"square_medium/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=fAHxxbQH","large":"square_large/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=iIIqpIj7","full":"square_full/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=Gp63O6N4"},"article":{"tiny":"article_tiny/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=lTnrVPsk","small":"article_small/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=ybEyHxnl","medium":"article_medium/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=bC6egXT2","large":"article_large/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=7wXr4yQv","full":"article_full/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=Cn5tRdhA"},"2x1":{"tiny":"2x1_tiny/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=webBS_q0","small":"2x1_small/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=zLl_Mxqa","medium":"2x1_medium/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=lJYlddxk","large":"2x1_large/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=xO7TLY0s","full":"2x1_full/public/GettyImages-1243993988.jpg?itok=EMHND5k0"}}},"teaser_body":"The junta's failure to maintain stability and resolve underlying grievances will raise the risk of future coups and provide possible inroads for more Russian influence.","pov":"","mailout":"In Burkina Faso, a supposedly thwarted coup is a stark indicator of the junta's failure to maintain stability and resolve underlying grievances that will raise the risk of other coup attempts and provide possible inroads for more Russian influence. On Sept. 27, the Burkinabe junta issued a statement claiming it had successfully thwarted a coup launched by other members of the military the day before. According to an official statement, the perpetrators of the attempted coup are now in custody, while efforts are underway to apprehend others involved. The announcement comes days after rumors surfaced on social media that several members of the military tried to overthrow Burkina Faso's interim president Ibrahim Traore. It's unclear whether the junta's claims are legitimate, as Traore's military government could be using an attempted coup as an excuse to further consolidate its political power by arresting would-be dissenters. Earlier in September, a separate group of military officers were detained due to suspicions of involvement in another coup attempt.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1695936766","created_formatted":"Sep 28, 2023 | 21:32 GMT","changed":"1695936766","changed_formatted":"Sep 28, 2023 | 21:32 GMT","path_alias":"article/what-alleged-coup-attempt-means-burkina-fasos-stability","article_type":{"tid":"505","vid":"30","name":"Snapshots"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"144","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Burkina Faso","code":"BF","path_alias":"/region/sub-saharan-africa/burkina-faso"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"144","vid":"5","name":"Burkina Faso"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342700","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"What Another Term Under Sanchez Would Mean for Spain","promo_image":{"uri":"public://GettyImages-1690221181.jpg","alt":"Acting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez comes back to the chamber as he attends the first session of a parliamentary debate to vote through a prime minister in Madrid on Sept. 26, 2023.

But this would come at the cost of deeper political polarization and a right-wing backlash in future elections. On Sept. 27, Spain's Congress of Deputies voted against appointing conservative leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo as prime minister, with 178 votes against and 172 votes in favor. A second investiture vote will take place on Sept. 29, but a similar outcome is likely because Feijoo will probably not obtain the support he needs to win it. Notably, the Sept. 27 vote has triggered a 60-day period to appoint a prime minister, or else a general election must take place in January. Acting socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will seek re-election in a new investiture vote in the coming weeks. In the likely case that the same number of lawmakers who voted against Feijoo support Sanchez, he will be re-appointed. The acting prime minister is already in negotiations with lawmakers from smaller political parties to secure a victory.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1695831679","created_formatted":"Sep 27, 2023 | 16:21 GMT","changed":"1695831679","changed_formatted":"Sep 27, 2023 | 16:21 GMT","path_alias":"article/what-another-term-under-sanchez-would-mean-spain","article_type":{"tid":"505","vid":"30","name":"Snapshots"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"97","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Spain","code":"ES","path_alias":"/region/europe/spain"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"97","vid":"5","name":"Spain"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342669","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"China, Japan and South Korea Will Resume Trilateral Talks, but Diplomatic Hurdles Remain","promo_image":{"uri":"public://china-japan-rok-1142491562.jpg","alt":"Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi speaks at the opening ceremony of the International Forum for Trilateral Cooperation that commemorated the 20th anniversary of trilateral cooperation among China, South Korea and Japan, in Beijing, China, on May 10, 2019.

The C5+1 began as an annual foreign ministers format meeting in 2015, and the 2023 meeting was the first involving presidents. Biden described the meeting as \"a historic moment, building on years of close cooperation\" and said the \"shared commitment to sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity\" would remain the cornerstone of their cooperation. Biden proposed a C5+1 Critical Minerals Dialogue to harness the region's abundant mineral resources and promote the security of critical mineral supply chains. The summit also addressed creating a more favorable business environment for U.S. trade and private sector investment in Central Asia, exploring opportunities for American companies in sectors such as critical minerals, renewable energy, manufacturing and others. Finally, Biden said the United States would strengthen counterterrorism cooperation with the five Central Asian nations and increase security funding in the region. While the meeting resulted in few concrete announcements, the attendees suggested that U.S. engagement with the region through this and possibly other formats was set to increase going forward.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1695391993","created_formatted":"Sep 22, 2023 | 14:13 GMT","changed":"1695391993","changed_formatted":"Sep 22, 2023 | 14:13

Trudeau further labeled the alleged incident \"an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty.\" The same day, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly announced the expulsion of the head of India's foreign intelligence agency in Canada. India has since responded by rejecting the allegations, calling them \"absurd\" and \"unsubstantiated\" and accusing Canada of providing \"shelter\" to Sikh separatist \"terrorists and extremists\" who \"continue to threaten India's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" India on Sept. 19 also announced the retaliatory expulsion of an unnamed senior Canadian diplomat.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1695159966","created_formatted":"Sep 19, 2023 | 21:46 GMT","changed":"1695220721","changed_formatted":"Sep 20, 2023 | 14:38 GMT","path_alias":"article/canada-india-ties-take-dive-following-ottawas-allegations","article_type":{"tid":"505","vid":"30","name":"Snapshots"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"35","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Canada","code":"CA","path_alias":"/region/americas/canada"},{"tid":"118","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"India","code":"IN","path_alias":"/region/south-asia/india"},{"tid":"528","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Economics","path_alias":"/topic/economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"35","vid":"5","name":"Canada"},{"tid":"118","vid":"5","name":"India"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"528","vid":"33","name":"Economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"}],"is_bookmarked":0}]},{"title":"Columns","template_id":"template24","limit":"8","type":"filtered_content_feed","subqueue_id":"","filter":{"type":["article","sectioned_content"],"taxonomy":{"article_type":[],"assessments_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"column_type":{"600":"600","601":"601","643":"643","644":"644"},"countries":[],"wv_themes":[],"wv_topics":[],"wv_series":[],"wv_event":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[]}},"nodes":[{"nid":"342716","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"Would Israeli-Saudi Normalization Bring the Regional Order the U.S. Wants?","promo_image":{"uri":"public://GettyImages-1241914104 (1).jpg","alt":"U.S. President Joe Biden makes his way to board Air Force One at Israel's Ben Gurion Airport on July 15, 2022, as he departs for Saudi Arabia after a two-day visit to Israel.

The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis compelled the G7 developed countries to recognize the growing importance of developing economies and led to the formation of the G20 as a meeting ground for finance ministers and central bankers. A decade later, the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 reshaped the G20 into a summit of national leaders, expanding its role and remit. In both cases, the interconnectedness of the global financial architecture and the rapid spread of economic challenges from one region to another provided the momentum for collaboration and collective action. However, the global economic disruptions triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic have not driven a similar reinvigoration of the G20. Although the group is considering expanding to include the African Union (AU) as a permanent member, the G20 is feeling the strains of a shifting global order. ","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1694188417","created_formatted":"Sep 8, 2023 | 15:53 GMT","changed":"1694437500","changed_formatted":"Sep 11, 2023 | 13:05

The number of illegal border crossings from Mexico to the United States has surged in recent weeks, growing from 144,570 crossings in June to 232,972 in August, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data. While data is not yet available for the full month of September, reports indicate that the month is on track to surpass the record 252,000 border crossings recorded in December 2022. The influx of migrants reaching the southern U.S. border has strained CBP resources, leading to the closure of some official crossings to divert personnel to support migrant processing efforts. Closures and increased inspections have led to massive delays for cargo vehicles waiting to cross into the United States, with thousands of trucks stranded due to wait times lasting multiple days in some areas. Migrants are continuing to arrive en masse at the border, with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador saying on Oct. 2 that 10,000 migrants are reaching the border each day.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696540767","created_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 21:19 GMT","changed":"1696540767","changed_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 21:19 GMT","path_alias":"article/political-and-economic-implications-us-mexico-border-crisis","article_type":{"tid":"502","vid":"30","name":"Assessments"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"49","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Mexico","code":"MX","path_alias":"/region/americas/mexico"},{"tid":"59","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"United States","code":"US","path_alias":"/region/americas/united-states"},{"tid":"528","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Economics","path_alias":"/topic/economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"49","vid":"5","name":"Mexico"},{"tid":"59","vid":"5","name":"United States"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"528","vid":"33","name":"Economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342789","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"Syria's Economic Woes Create New Fractures and Power Struggles","promo_image":{"uri":"public://GettyImages-1637446734.jpg","alt":"People protest in the southern Syrian city of Sweida on Sept. 1, 2023, after the government of President Bashar al Assad ended fuel subsidies.","title":"People protest in the southern Syrian city of Sweida on Sept. 1, 2023, after the government of President Bashar al Assad ended fuel subsidies.","caption":"People protest in the southern Syrian city of Sweida on Sept. 1, 2023, after the government of President Bashar al Assad ended fuel subsidies.\r\n","credit":"(SAM HARIRI/AFP via Getty Images)","sizes":{"16x9":{"tiny":"16x9_tiny/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=rm0x0sX9","small":"16x9_small/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=G6LsDa28","medium":"16x9_medium/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=ISH9Mgy4","large":"16x9_large/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=iDChwvZd","full":"16x9_full/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=rH9r2Awx"},"square":{"tiny":"square_tiny/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=d2dfNMtQ","small":"square_small/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=JQBAcCis","medium":"square_medium/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=iep6L09S","large":"square_large/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=9lICAEN6","full":"square_full/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=IkqOIqHW"},"article":{"tiny":"article_tiny/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=eCHCdqTQ","small":"article_small/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=4O1EmNDT","medium":"article_medium/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=IFxhJqnv","large":"article_large/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=adnoeueA","full":"article_full/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=_1Yyuyum"},"2x1":{"tiny":"2x1_tiny/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=sfVu7QgR","small":"2x1_small/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=NkWNaXPg","medium":"2x1_medium/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=V5FYCDPK","large":"2x1_large/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=cMJS-aHH","full":"2x1_full/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=sIBZXPGy"}}},"teaser_body":"Growing economic distress and frozen reconstruction efforts are threatening the legitimacy of established actors, providing space for extremists to exploit.","pov":"","mailout":"In Syria, growing economic distress and frozen reconstruction efforts are threatening the legitimacy of established actors, in turn providing space for extremists to exploit. Fighting in Syria has dramatically declined as the frontlines of the civil war have largely been frozen since 2020. But new fractures have recently begun to emerge behind those established frontlines. Since August, a series of protests and skirmishes have broken out in territory nominally controlled by one of Syria's major factions. In the government-controlled southern city of Swedia, Druze demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest against President Bashar al Assad's economic policies, resulting in violence between protesters and government forces. Meanwhile, in the northwest, a dispute over sharing oil revenues triggered bloody clashes last month between ostensibly allied Arab tribes and the U.S.-aligned Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), leading to the deaths of dozens of fighters. The unrest took place against the backdrop of President Assad's first state visit to China since 2004, where he attempted to win Chinese aid to help foot his war-torn country's U.N.-estimated $500 billion reconstruction bill. But he left the visit without any concrete funding pledges, with China only promising to continue supporting Syria, which is a member of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) member. ","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696532034","created_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 18:53 GMT","changed":"1696532034","changed_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 18:53 GMT","path_alias":"article/syrias-economic-woes-create-new-fractures-and-power-struggles","article_type":{"tid":"502","vid":"30","name":"Assessments"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"136","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Syria","code":"SY","path_alias":"/region/middle-east-and-north-africa/syria"},{"tid":"528","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Economics","path_alias":"/topic/economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"136","vid":"5","name":"Syria"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"528","vid":"33","name":"Economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342771","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"U.S. Naval Update Map: Oct. 5, 2023","promo_image":{"uri":"public://naval-update-map-20231004-display.png","alt":"Naval Update Map display","title":"","caption":"","credit":"(RANE)","sizes":{"16x9":{"tiny":"16x9_tiny/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=o2H12g68","small":"16x9_small/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=_tkyAEfD","medium":"16x9_medium/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=x1RY9mfQ","large":"16x9_large/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=nNGtzF4p","full":"16x9_full/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=ABOGstRn"},"square":{"tiny":"square_tiny/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=_4QlgWUn","small":"square_small/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=HEFvswlG","medium":"square_medium/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=u0Abykda","large":"square_large/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=PTP5BJgQ","full":"square_full/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=QUQFjkEL"},"article":{"tiny":"article_tiny/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=m7uaTudq","small":"article_small/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=dJwQEfjS","medium":"article_medium/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=ZwrJjeus","large":"article_large/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=qAbjK3XG","full":"article_full/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=96Q4Ovse"},"2x1":{"tiny":"2x1_tiny/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=b8RYIavH","small":"2x1_small/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=MOAxNxyo","medium":"2x1_medium/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=lv7I0YvF","large":"2x1_large/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=6LbE8Tqo","full":"2x1_full/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=IS6n_p5G"}}},"teaser_body":"This map shows the approximate locations of U.S. Carrier Strike Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups.","pov":"","mailout":"The Naval Update Map shows the approximate current locations of U.S. Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) and Amphibious Ready Groups (ARGs), based on available open-source information.

The statement comes after Kirby on Sept. 29 revealed an ''unprecedented'' deployment of Serbian troops along the border and announced that NATO would be deploying more peacekeepers in northern Kosovo to deter a possible invasion. In the intervening days, following U.S. and EU pressure, Serbian officials stated that they had withdrawn some of the troops their country had stationed near the border, taking the overall number from 8,350 down to 4,500 forces. In an Oct. 2 interview with the Financial Times, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said that Belgrade does not seek a war with Kosovo, and his army chief General Milan Mojsilovic confirmed the

taking steps to expand its economic, political and military influence in the Pacific islands, but delays caused by political deadlock could forestall further gains. The United States and the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) concluded their second annual summit in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 25. At the summit, the U.S. government promised development and infrastructure aid packages totaling $200 million in new funds, a relatively large sum even when spread across 18 countries given these states' small economies. Most notably, the package includes $64 million in development aid and $40 million in infrastructure aid. The United States also announced its formal recognition of the Cook Islands and Niue, two small island countries that outsource their defense to New Zealand, as independent nations. According to Washington, its cooperation with countries and territories in Oceania is aimed at addressing climate change, protecting maritime boundaries and marine resources (a reference to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, specifically by China), and promoting \"a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\" During the Sept. 25 summit, the countries also reaffirmed the 2022 U.S.-Pacific Partner Strategy, the flagship document that codified the U.S.-PIF partnership and the key deliverable of last year's inaugural U.S.-PIF summit. Moreover, on Sept. 28, media reports revealed that the United States is backing the construction of the Central Pacific Cable, an undersea internet cable covering thousands of miles that will link U.S. territories American Samoa and Guam before extending to 10 Pacific island countries and territories.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696002806","created_formatted":"Sep 29, 2023 | 15:53 GMT","changed":"1696002806","changed_formatted":"Sep 29, 2023 | 15:53 GMT","path_alias":"article/strategic-goals-and-political-hurdles-us-play-tug-war-over-pacific-islands","article_type":{"tid":"502","vid":"30","name":"Assessments"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"59","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"United States","code":"US","path_alias":"/region/americas/united-states"},{"tid":"192","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Australia","code":"AU","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/australia"},{"tid":"747","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Samoa","code":"WS","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/samoa"},{"tid":"195","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"China","code":"CN","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/china"},{"tid":"197","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Federated States of Micronesia","code":"FM","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/federated-states-micronesia"},{"tid":"198","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Fiji","code":"FJ","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/fiji"},{"tid":"201","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Kiribati","code":"KI","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/kiribati"},{"tid":"204","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Marshall Islands","code":"MH","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/marshall-islands"},{"tid":"207","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Nauru","code":"NR","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/nauru"},{"tid":"208","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/new-zealand"},{"tid":"210","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Palau","code":"PW","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/palau"},{"tid":"211","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Papua New Guinea","code":"PG","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/papua-new-guinea"},{"tid":"214","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Solomon Islands","code":"SB","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/solomon-islands"},{"tid":"218","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Tonga","code":"TO","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/tonga"},{"tid":"219","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Tuvalu","code":"TV","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/tuvalu"},{"tid":"220","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Vanuatu","code":"VU","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/vanuatu"},{"tid":"528","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Economics","path_alias":"/topic/economics"},{"tid":"524","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Environment, Science \u0026 Technology","path_alias":"/topic/environment-science-technology"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"59","vid":"5","name":"United States"},{"tid":"192","vid":"5","name":"Australia"},{"tid":"747","vid":"5","name":"Samoa"},{"tid":"195","vid":"5","name":"China"},{"tid":"197","vid":"5","name":"Federated States of Micronesia"},{"tid":"198","vid":"5","name":"Fiji"},{"tid":"201","vid":"5","name":"Kiribati"},{"tid":"204","vid":"5","name":"Marshall Islands"},{"tid":"207","vid":"5","name":"Nauru"},{"tid":"208","vid":"5","name":"New Zealand"},{"tid":"210","vid":"5","name":"Palau"},{"tid":"211","vid":"5","name":"Papua New Guinea"},{"tid":"214","vid":"5","name":"Solomon Islands"},{"tid":"218","vid":"5","name":"Tonga"},{"tid":"219","vid":"5","name":"Tuvalu"},{"tid":"220","vid":"5","name":"Vanuatu"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"528","vid":"33","name":"Economics"},{"tid":"524","vid":"33","name":"Environment, Science \u0026 Technology"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"},{"tid":"1661","vid":"33","name":"U.S.-China Relations"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342698","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"The Appeal (and Perils) of Crime Crackdowns in Latin America, Part 2","promo_image":{"uri":"public://el-salvador-1473759584.jpg","alt":"Salvadoran security forces move a second group of 2,000 detainees overnight to the mega-prison Terrorist Confinement Center on March 15, 2023, in Tecoluca, El Salvador.

In March 2022, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele imposed a state of emergency to combat violent crime, with a focus on the country's two largest criminal groups, Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18. A massive crackdown on organized crime under the state of emergency led to a dramatic drop in the country's homicide rate, making it one of the safest countries in the region. Seeing El Salvador's success, in November 2022, Honduran President Xiomara Castro implemented a similar (albeit significantly less extensive) state of emergency to combat violent crime and extortion.

The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis compelled the G7 developed countries to recognize the growing importance of developing economies and led to the formation of the G20 as a meeting ground for finance ministers and central bankers. A decade later, the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 reshaped the G20 into a summit of national leaders, expanding its role and remit. In both cases, the interconnectedness of the global financial architecture and the rapid spread of economic challenges from one region to another provided the momentum for collaboration and collective action. However, the global economic disruptions triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic have not driven a similar reinvigoration of the G20. Although the group is considering expanding to include the African Union (AU) as a permanent member, the G20 is feeling the strains of a shifting global order. ","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1694188417","created_formatted":"Sep 8, 2023 | 15:53 GMT","changed":"1694437500","changed_formatted":"Sep 11, 2023 | 13:05

At the summit, the U.S. government promised development and infrastructure aid packages totaling $200 million in new funds, a relatively large sum even when spread across 18 countries given these states' small economies. Most notably, the package includes $64 million in development aid and $40 million in infrastructure aid. The United States also announced its formal recognition of the Cook Islands and Niue, two small island countries that outsource their defense to New Zealand, as independent nations. According to Washington, its cooperation with countries and territories in Oceania is aimed at addressing climate change, protecting maritime boundaries and marine resources (a reference to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, specifically by China), and promoting \"a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\" During the Sept. 25 summit, the countries also reaffirmed the 2022 U.S.-Pacific Partner Strategy, the flagship document that codified the U.S.-PIF partnership and the key deliverable of last year's inaugural U.S.-PIF summit. Moreover, on Sept. 28, media reports revealed that the United States is backing the construction of the Central Pacific Cable, an undersea internet cable covering thousands of miles that will link U.S. territories American Samoa and Guam before extending to 10 Pacific island countries and territories.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696002806","created_formatted":"Sep 29, 2023

Faso, a supposedly thwarted coup is a stark indicator of the junta's failure to maintain stability and resolve underlying grievances that will raise the risk of other coup attempts and provide possible inroads for more Russian influence. On Sept. 27, the Burkinabe junta issued a statement claiming it had successfully thwarted a coup launched by other members of the military the day before. According to an official statement, the perpetrators of the attempted coup are now in custody, while efforts are underway to apprehend others involved. The announcement comes days after rumors surfaced on social media that several members of the military tried to overthrow Burkina Faso's interim president Ibrahim Traore. It's unclear whether the junta's claims are legitimate, as Traore's military government could be using an attempted coup as an excuse to further consolidate its political power by arresting would-be dissenters. Earlier in September, a separate group of military officers were detained due to suspicions of involvement in another coup attempt.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1695936766","created_formatted":"Sep 28, 2023 | 21:32 GMT","changed":"1695936766","changed_formatted":"Sep 28, 2023 | 21:32 GMT","path_alias":"article/what-alleged-coup-attempt-means-burkina-fasos-stability","article_type":{"tid":"505","vid":"30","name":"Snapshots"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"144","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Burkina Faso","code":"BF","path_alias":"/region/sub-saharan-africa/burkina-faso"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"144","vid":"5","name":"Burkina Faso"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342716","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"Would Israeli-Saudi Normalization Bring the Regional Order the U.S. Wants?","promo_image":{"uri":"public://GettyImages-1241914104 (1).jpg","alt":"U.S. President Joe Biden makes his way to board Air Force One at Israel's Ben Gurion Airport on July 15, 2022, as he departs for Saudi Arabia after a two-day visit to Israel.

The number of illegal border crossings from Mexico to the United States has surged in recent weeks, growing from 144,570 crossings in June to 232,972 in August, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data. While data is not yet available for the full month of September, reports indicate that the month is on track to surpass the record 252,000 border crossings recorded in December 2022. The influx of migrants reaching the southern U.S. border has strained CBP resources, leading to the closure of some official crossings to divert personnel to support migrant processing efforts. Closures and increased inspections have led to massive delays for cargo vehicles waiting to cross into the United States, with thousands of trucks stranded due to wait times lasting multiple days in some areas. Migrants are continuing to arrive en masse at the border, with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador saying on Oct. 2 that 10,000 migrants are reaching the border each day.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696540767","created_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 21:19 GMT","changed":"1696540767","changed_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 21:19 GMT","path_alias":"article/political-and-economic-implications-us-mexico-border-crisis","article_type":{"tid":"502","vid":"30","name":"Assessments"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"49","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Mexico","code":"MX","path_alias":"/region/americas/mexico"},{"tid":"59","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"United States","code":"US","path_alias":"/region/americas/united-states"},{"tid":"528","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Economics","path_alias":"/topic/economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"49","vid":"5","name":"Mexico"},{"tid":"59","vid":"5","name":"United States"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"528","vid":"33","name":"Economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342789","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"Syria's Economic Woes Create New Fractures and Power Struggles","promo_image":{"uri":"public://GettyImages-1637446734.jpg","alt":"People protest in the southern Syrian city of Sweida on Sept. 1, 2023, after the government of President Bashar al Assad ended fuel subsidies.","title":"People protest in the southern Syrian city of Sweida on Sept. 1, 2023, after the government of President Bashar al Assad ended fuel subsidies.","caption":"People protest in the southern Syrian city of Sweida on Sept. 1, 2023, after the government of President Bashar al Assad ended fuel subsidies.\r\n","credit":"(SAM HARIRI/AFP via Getty Images)","sizes":{"16x9":{"tiny":"16x9_tiny/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=rm0x0sX9","small":"16x9_small/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=G6LsDa28","medium":"16x9_medium/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=ISH9Mgy4","large":"16x9_large/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=iDChwvZd","full":"16x9_full/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=rH9r2Awx"},"square":{"tiny":"square_tiny/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=d2dfNMtQ","small":"square_small/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=JQBAcCis","medium":"square_medium/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=iep6L09S","large":"square_large/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=9lICAEN6","full":"square_full/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=IkqOIqHW"},"article":{"tiny":"article_tiny/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=eCHCdqTQ","small":"article_small/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=4O1EmNDT","medium":"article_medium/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=IFxhJqnv","large":"article_large/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=adnoeueA","full":"article_full/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=_1Yyuyum"},"2x1":{"tiny":"2x1_tiny/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=sfVu7QgR","small":"2x1_small/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=NkWNaXPg","medium":"2x1_medium/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=V5FYCDPK","large":"2x1_large/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=cMJS-aHH","full":"2x1_full/public/GettyImages-1637446734.jpg?itok=sIBZXPGy"}}},"teaser_body":"Growing economic distress and frozen reconstruction efforts are threatening the legitimacy of established actors, providing space for extremists to exploit.","pov":"","mailout":"In Syria, growing economic distress and frozen reconstruction efforts are threatening the legitimacy of established actors, in turn providing space for extremists to exploit. Fighting in Syria has dramatically declined as the frontlines of the civil war have largely been frozen since 2020. But new fractures have recently begun to emerge behind those established frontlines. Since August, a series of protests and skirmishes have broken out in territory nominally controlled by one of Syria's major factions. In the government-controlled southern city of Swedia, Druze demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest against President Bashar al Assad's economic policies, resulting in violence between protesters and government forces. Meanwhile, in the northwest, a dispute over sharing oil revenues triggered bloody clashes last month between ostensibly allied Arab tribes and the U.S.-aligned Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), leading to the deaths of dozens of fighters. The unrest took place against the backdrop of President Assad's first state visit to China since 2004, where he attempted to win Chinese aid to help foot his war-torn country's U.N.-estimated $500 billion reconstruction bill. But he left the visit without any concrete funding pledges, with China only promising to continue supporting Syria, which is a member of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) member. ","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696532034","created_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 18:53 GMT","changed":"1696532034","changed_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 18:53 GMT","path_alias":"article/syrias-economic-woes-create-new-fractures-and-power-struggles","article_type":{"tid":"502","vid":"30","name":"Assessments"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"136","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Syria","code":"SY","path_alias":"/region/middle-east-and-north-africa/syria"},{"tid":"528","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Economics","path_alias":"/topic/economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"136","vid":"5","name":"Syria"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"528","vid":"33","name":"Economics"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342771","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"U.S. Naval Update Map: Oct. 5, 2023","promo_image":{"uri":"public://naval-update-map-20231004-display.png","alt":"Naval Update Map display","title":"","caption":"","credit":"(RANE)","sizes":{"16x9":{"tiny":"16x9_tiny/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=o2H12g68","small":"16x9_small/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=_tkyAEfD","medium":"16x9_medium/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=x1RY9mfQ","large":"16x9_large/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=nNGtzF4p","full":"16x9_full/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=ABOGstRn"},"square":{"tiny":"square_tiny/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=_4QlgWUn","small":"square_small/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=HEFvswlG","medium":"square_medium/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=u0Abykda","large":"square_large/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=PTP5BJgQ","full":"square_full/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=QUQFjkEL"},"article":{"tiny":"article_tiny/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=m7uaTudq","small":"article_small/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=dJwQEfjS","medium":"article_medium/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=ZwrJjeus","large":"article_large/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=qAbjK3XG","full":"article_full/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=96Q4Ovse"},"2x1":{"tiny":"2x1_tiny/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=b8RYIavH","small":"2x1_small/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=MOAxNxyo","medium":"2x1_medium/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=lv7I0YvF","large":"2x1_large/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=6LbE8Tqo","full":"2x1_full/public/naval-update-map-20231004-display.png?itok=IS6n_p5G"}}},"teaser_body":"This map shows the approximate locations of U.S. Carrier Strike Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups.","pov":"","mailout":"The Naval Update Map shows the approximate current locations of U.S. Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) and Amphibious Ready Groups (ARGs), based on available open-source information.

The statement comes after Kirby on Sept. 29 revealed an ''unprecedented'' deployment of Serbian troops along the border and announced that NATO would be deploying more peacekeepers in northern Kosovo to deter a possible invasion. In the intervening days, following U.S. and EU pressure, Serbian officials stated that they had withdrawn some of the troops their country had stationed near the border, taking the overall number from 8,350 down to 4,500 forces. In an Oct. 2 interview with the Financial Times, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said that Belgrade does not seek a war with Kosovo, and his army chief General Milan Mojsilovic confirmed the

taking steps to expand its economic, political and military influence in the Pacific islands, but delays caused by political deadlock could forestall further gains. The United States and the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) concluded their second annual summit in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 25. At the summit, the U.S. government promised development and infrastructure aid packages totaling $200 million in new funds, a relatively large sum even when spread across 18 countries given these states' small economies. Most notably, the package includes $64 million in development aid and $40 million in infrastructure aid. The United States also announced its formal recognition of the Cook Islands and Niue, two small island countries that outsource their defense to New Zealand, as independent nations. According to Washington, its cooperation with countries and territories in Oceania is aimed at addressing climate change, protecting maritime boundaries and marine resources (a reference to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, specifically by China), and promoting \"a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\" During the Sept. 25 summit, the countries also reaffirmed the 2022 U.S.-Pacific Partner Strategy, the flagship document that codified the U.S.-PIF partnership and the key deliverable of last year's inaugural U.S.-PIF summit. Moreover, on Sept. 28, media reports revealed that the United States is backing the construction of the Central Pacific Cable, an undersea internet cable covering thousands of miles that will link U.S. territories American Samoa and Guam before extending to 10 Pacific island countries and territories.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696002806","created_formatted":"Sep 29, 2023 | 15:53 GMT","changed":"1696002806","changed_formatted":"Sep 29, 2023 | 15:53 GMT","path_alias":"article/strategic-goals-and-political-hurdles-us-play-tug-war-over-pacific-islands","article_type":{"tid":"502","vid":"30","name":"Assessments"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"59","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"United States","code":"US","path_alias":"/region/americas/united-states"},{"tid":"192","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Australia","code":"AU","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/australia"},{"tid":"747","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Samoa","code":"WS","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/samoa"},{"tid":"195","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"China","code":"CN","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/china"},{"tid":"197","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Federated States of Micronesia","code":"FM","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/federated-states-micronesia"},{"tid":"198","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Fiji","code":"FJ","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/fiji"},{"tid":"201","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Kiribati","code":"KI","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/kiribati"},{"tid":"204","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Marshall Islands","code":"MH","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/marshall-islands"},{"tid":"207","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Nauru","code":"NR","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/nauru"},{"tid":"208","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"New Zealand","code":"NZ","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/new-zealand"},{"tid":"210","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Palau","code":"PW","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/palau"},{"tid":"211","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Papua New Guinea","code":"PG","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/papua-new-guinea"},{"tid":"214","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Solomon Islands","code":"SB","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/solomon-islands"},{"tid":"218","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Tonga","code":"TO","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/tonga"},{"tid":"219","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Tuvalu","code":"TV","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/tuvalu"},{"tid":"220","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"Vanuatu","code":"VU","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/vanuatu"},{"tid":"528","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Economics","path_alias":"/topic/economics"},{"tid":"524","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Environment, Science \u0026 Technology","path_alias":"/topic/environment-science-technology"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Military \u0026 Security","path_alias":"/topic/military-security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"59","vid":"5","name":"United States"},{"tid":"192","vid":"5","name":"Australia"},{"tid":"747","vid":"5","name":"Samoa"},{"tid":"195","vid":"5","name":"China"},{"tid":"197","vid":"5","name":"Federated States of Micronesia"},{"tid":"198","vid":"5","name":"Fiji"},{"tid":"201","vid":"5","name":"Kiribati"},{"tid":"204","vid":"5","name":"Marshall Islands"},{"tid":"207","vid":"5","name":"Nauru"},{"tid":"208","vid":"5","name":"New Zealand"},{"tid":"210","vid":"5","name":"Palau"},{"tid":"211","vid":"5","name":"Papua New Guinea"},{"tid":"214","vid":"5","name":"Solomon Islands"},{"tid":"218","vid":"5","name":"Tonga"},{"tid":"219","vid":"5","name":"Tuvalu"},{"tid":"220","vid":"5","name":"Vanuatu"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"528","vid":"33","name":"Economics"},{"tid":"524","vid":"33","name":"Environment, Science \u0026 Technology"},{"tid":"529","vid":"33","name":"Military \u0026 Security"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"},{"tid":"1661","vid":"33","name":"U.S.-China Relations"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342698","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"The Appeal (and Perils) of Crime Crackdowns in Latin America, Part 2","promo_image":{"uri":"public://el-salvador-1473759584.jpg","alt":"Salvadoran security forces move a second group of 2,000 detainees overnight to the mega-prison Terrorist Confinement Center on March 15, 2023, in Tecoluca, El Salvador.

After visiting China, the same group of U.S. senators will then travel to South Korea and Japan, other key players in global chip markets.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696364727","created_formatted":"Oct 3, 2023 | 20:25 GMT","changed":"1696364727","changed_formatted":"Oct 3, 2023 | 20:25 GMT","path_alias":"article/setting-expectations-first-us-congressional-visit-china-years","article_type":{"tid":"505","vid":"30","name":"Snapshots"},"assessments_type":[],"column_type":[],"media_type":[],"global_perspectives_type":[],"sectioned_content_type":[],"forecast_type":[],"www_public_postings_type":[],"source":"","www_site_page_type":[],"taxonomy":[{"tid":"59","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"United States","code":"US","path_alias":"/region/americas/united-states"},{"tid":"195","vid":"5","v_name":"countries","name":"China","code":"CN","path_alias":"/region/asia-pacific/china"},{"tid":"524","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Environment, Science \u0026 Technology","path_alias":"/topic/environment-science-technology"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","v_name":"wv_topics","name":"Politics","path_alias":"/topic/politics"}],"author":[],"pdf":"","status":1,"premium":1,"countries":[{"tid":"59","vid":"5","name":"United States"},{"tid":"195","vid":"5","name":"China"}],"wv_topics":[{"tid":"524","vid":"33","name":"Environment, Science \u0026 Technology"},{"tid":"530","vid":"33","name":"Politics"},{"tid":"1661","vid":"33","name":"U.S.-China Relations"}],"is_bookmarked":0},{"nid":"342750","type":"article","ntype":"worldview","title":"What Slovakia's Election Results Mean for Its Political Future and Support for Ukraine","promo_image":{"uri":"public://slovakia-1701716522 (2).jpg","alt":"Former Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico waits to meet the country's president in Bratislava on Oct. 2, 2023, following his Smer party's victory in Slovakia's Sept. 30 snap election.

According to an official statement, the perpetrators of the attempted coup are now in custody, while efforts are underway to apprehend others involved. The announcement comes days after rumors surfaced on social media that several members of the military tried to overthrow Burkina Faso's interim president Ibrahim Traore. It's unclear whether the junta's claims are legitimate, as Traore's military government could be using an attempted coup as an excuse to further consolidate its political power by arresting would-be dissenters.

But this would come at the cost of deeper political polarization and a right-wing backlash in future elections. On Sept. 27, Spain's Congress of Deputies voted against appointing conservative leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo as prime minister, with 178 votes against and 172 votes in favor. A second investiture vote will take place on Sept. 29, but a similar outcome is likely because Feijoo will probably not obtain the support he needs to win it. Notably, the Sept. 27 vote has triggered a 60-day period to appoint a prime minister, or else a general election must take place in January. Acting socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez will seek re-election in a new investiture vote in the coming weeks. In the likely case that the same number of lawmakers who voted against Feijoo support Sanchez, he will be re-appointed.

On Sept. 20, U.S. President Joe Biden hosted the first-ever heads of state summit between the United States and Central Asia's five countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan), a cooperation format known as the C5+1. The C5+1 began as an annual foreign ministers format meeting in 2015, and the 2023 meeting was the first involving presidents. Biden described the meeting as \"a historic moment, building on years of close cooperation\" and said the \"shared commitment to sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity\" would remain the cornerstone of their cooperation. Biden proposed a C5+1 Critical Minerals Dialogue to harness the region's abundant mineral resources and promote the security of critical mineral supply chains. The summit also addressed creating a more favorable business environment for U.S. trade and private sector investment in Central Asia, exploring opportunities for American companies in sectors such as critical minerals, renewable energy, manufacturing and others. Finally, Biden said the United States would strengthen counterterrorism cooperation with the five Central Asian nations and increase security funding in the region. While the meeting resulted in few concrete announcements, the attendees suggested that U.S. engagement with the region through this and possibly other formats was set to increase going forward.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1695391993","created_formatted":"Sep 22, 2023 | 14:13 GMT","changed":"1695391993","changed_formatted":"Sep 22, 2023 | 14:13

The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis compelled the G7 developed countries to recognize the growing importance of developing economies and led to the formation of the G20 as a meeting ground for finance ministers and central bankers. A decade later, the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 reshaped the G20 into a summit of national leaders, expanding its role and remit. In both cases, the interconnectedness of the global financial architecture and the rapid spread of economic challenges from one region to another provided the momentum for collaboration and collective action. However, the global economic disruptions triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic have not driven a similar reinvigoration of the G20. Although the group is considering expanding to include the African Union (AU) as a permanent member, the G20 is feeling the strains of a shifting global order. ","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1694188417","created_formatted":"Sep 8, 2023 | 15:53 GMT","changed":"1694437500","changed_formatted":"Sep 11, 2023 | 13:05

The number of illegal border crossings from Mexico to the United States has surged in recent weeks, growing from 144,570 crossings in June to 232,972 in August, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data. While data is not yet available for the full month of September, reports indicate that the month is on track to surpass the record 252,000 border crossings recorded in December 2022. The influx of migrants reaching the southern U.S. border has strained CBP resources, leading to the closure of some official crossings to divert personnel to support migrant processing efforts. Closures and increased inspections have led to massive delays for cargo vehicles waiting to cross into the United States, with thousands of trucks stranded due to wait times lasting multiple days in some areas. Migrants are continuing to arrive en masse at the border, with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador saying on Oct. 2 that 10,000 migrants are reaching the border each day.","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696540767","created_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 21:19 GMT","changed":"1696540767","changed_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 21:19

distress and frozen reconstruction efforts are threatening the legitimacy of established actors, in turn providing space for extremists to exploit. Fighting in Syria has dramatically declined as the frontlines of the civil war have largely been frozen since 2020. But new fractures have recently begun to emerge behind those established frontlines. Since August, a series of protests and skirmishes have broken out in territory nominally controlled by one of Syria's major factions. In the government-controlled southern city of Swedia, Druze demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest against President Bashar al Assad's economic policies, resulting in violence between protesters and government forces. Meanwhile, in the northwest, a dispute over sharing oil revenues triggered bloody clashes last month between ostensibly allied Arab tribes and the U.S.-aligned Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), leading to the deaths of dozens of fighters. The unrest took place against the backdrop of President Assad's first state visit to China since 2004, where he attempted to win Chinese aid to help foot his war-torn country's U.N.-estimated $500 billion reconstruction bill. But he left the visit without any concrete funding pledges, with China only promising to continue supporting Syria, which is a member of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) member. ","overview":"","youtube_video_url":"","created":"1696532034","created_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 18:53 GMT","changed":"1696532034","changed_formatted":"Oct 5, 2023 | 18:53
