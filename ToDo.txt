1. Make Flow chart for CNN algorithm
2. Take 100 live phishy URLs and test them on top 1000 and top 200 favicons (separately).
3. Observe the accuracy in both the cases for classification of 100 phishy URLs.

3. Remove the common words like 'you', 'I', 'me', etc. and articles from the frequent terms list.
4. Test against various pre-trained models: VGGs, ResNet, DenseNet, GoogLeNet, etc.
5. Test code against the database of top-200, 500, 1000, 1500 domains. Observe what size of the database is sufficient for logo Similarity.
